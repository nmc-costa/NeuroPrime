    "\n",
    "In general, persons are constantly in a trying state, immersed in thoughs and reflection processes about past and future tasks. Can we affect a person to be in a more sensing state, focused in present tasks and without judjement (reflection processes)? Consequently, does this have effects on self-regulation and focus on mental strategies to affect brain activity? \n",

    "Theoretically, an NFT framework implies that any observable measure of brain activity can be extracted and tested for volitional control. Nonetheless, what constitutes successful control, and how to quantify it? In the engineering sense, successful control can be viewed as enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a parameter relative to a control condition, a reference condition (e.g., resting-state, sham, or sensory stimulation without control), which could be administered sequentially or interspersed randomly in the experiment (Tomas Ros et al., 2014). Dempster and Vernon (D Vernon et al., 2009) suggested three major measures that can be used to assess feature changes of brain activity during NF:\n",
    "1. Changes in absolute values of frequency band amplitude/power (e.g. (Angelakis et al., 2007)).\n",
    "2. Percentage of time in brain activity target (tBAT), basically the percent time spent in the desired brain state. Thus, this is the time spent above or beneath a specific threshold when self-regulating one’s brain activity.\n",
    "3. Tonic increase, multiplication of the absolute amplitude (1.) with tBAT (2.).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are more oscillatory parameters reported to be volitionally controlled including phase-locking (Brunner et al., 2006) and nonlinear fractal dimension (Wang et al., 2011).\n",
    "Based on these measures, one can assess feature changes in four different ways (S Enriquez-Geppert & Huster, 2017) : (1) within sessions, for instance by comparing the beginning of each session with the end of a training session (sessions can be arbitrarily divided into blocks or segments for statistical analyses); (2) possible changes in these measures within a session observed as a difference relative to a baseline measurement, where participants neither try to control their brain activity nor receive any feedback; as (3) changes observed from session-to-session; and accordingly also as (4) changes across sessions relative to a baseline measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, `hypothesis testing` may be applied to test whether during NFT there is a significant difference in the mean together with a reduction (or no change) in the variability of the controlled signal (between the different conditions). With respect to existing methods in the literature, this approach is technically equivalent to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Student’s t-test, which similarly account for a variable’s mean and variance. If multiple confounding variables are involved, it might then be appropriate to use a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) (Tomas Ros et al., 2014). \n",
